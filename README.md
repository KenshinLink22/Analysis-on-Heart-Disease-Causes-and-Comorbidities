# Heart-Disease
The purpose of the journal is to analyze potential causes of heart disease and comorbidities. The CSV file was collected from ["Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease" on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease). The data was collected by the CDC in 2020 which surveyed adults. Presentation of journal can be found on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/mwIqhxj-oXE).
